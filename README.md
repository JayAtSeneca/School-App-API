The School App API is a web application developed using ASP.NET Core and designed to provide a platform for learning Token Based Authentication in ASP.NET. This API allows users to manage student information, including personal details and academic records, securely and efficiently. The API implements token-based authentication, which provides a secure way for users to access their data. This API can be used as a reference for students or developers who are interested in learning how to implement token-based authentication in ASP.NET Core. This API can also be integrated into a larger project for a school management system or used as a standalone application for managing student information.


## My Learnings

In this project, I learned how to generate new access and refresh tokens, sign up and log in users using tokens, and add role-based constraints and configure roles as part of the token claims. It helped me in learning about token-based authentication and understanding that how it works in ASP.NET Core applications.
